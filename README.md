## About

This repository contains everything needed to build a customized [mfsBSD](https://mfsbsd.vx.sk/) image that can be used to provision [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) servers with [Foreman](https://theforeman.org/).

## Requirements

In order to deploy FreeBSD servers with Foreman, the following requirements must be met:

* Provisioning templates for FreeBSD are already included in Foreman
* A custom mfsBSD image, can be build manually (see below) or downloaded from here
* A working PXE/DHCP/TFTP boot environment (Foreman Smart Proxy)
* Server or VM needs at least 1 GB of RAM to store the image during installation

## Provision Instructions

* Create a "installation media" entry in Foreman for FreeBSD (use local or official mirror, i.e. `http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/$arch/$major.$minor-RELEASE/`)
* Create a new "operating system" entry in Foreman for the desired FreeBSD release
* Copy the custom mfsBSD image to your TFTP server
* Create a new host in Foreman, watch the FreeBSD installation begin :)

## Build Instructions

Use `build.sh` to create your own images or to include a modified version of `rc.local`. The script must be run as root (on a FreeBSD server).

```
# git clone git@github.com:fraenki/foreman-freebsd.git
# cd foreman-freebsd
# ./build.sh
```
